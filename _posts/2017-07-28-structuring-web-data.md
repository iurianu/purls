<h4>Why Structured Data?</h4>
The structured data markup splits the content on a webpage in semantic-related blocks, so the search bots know exactly how to categorize each piece of information they find, in order to add it to the Global Knowledge Graph, a worldwide structured knowledge database, which all the Search Engines use.
And more, in order to extend the basic schema, which is an entry-level vocabulary, w3.org, the main authority in the internet domain, provides additional vocabularies, and ontologies, so developers can build new custom, domain-based vocabularies, mapped on the content they want to mark up.
The more specific the vocabulary is, the more qualitative information will the Search Engines get from your website, and they will consider your website an authority in your domain, and the information provided as accurate.
<h4>Integrating in the Web</h4>
Since 2012, when all the main Search Engines adopted Schema.org markup, more and more websites started to implement structured data markup, in order to provide a correct, and complete description of the content on their websites.
<h4>The WEB Ontologies</h4>
The use of ontologies provides a very powerful way to describe objects and their relationships to other objects.
Ontologies resemble class hierarchies in object-oriented programming but there are several critical differences. Since the “Semantic Web” notion finally got a meaning, more ontologies were created by different Organizations/Entities, the most notable being DublinCore, FOAF, SKOS, and OWL.
