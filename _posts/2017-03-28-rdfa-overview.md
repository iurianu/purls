RDFa (Resource Description Framework in attributes), consists of a few attributes that may be used to express machine-readable data in Web documents like HTML, SVG, and XML. While it is not a complete solution for advanced data markup tasks, it does work for most day-to-day needs and can be learned by most Web authors in a day.

<em>RDFa</em> is an extension that supports linked data by introducing HTML tag attributes that correspond to the user-visible content you want to describe for search engines.
It helps markup things like People, Places, Events, Recipes and Reviews.
Search Engines and Web Services use this markup to generate better search listings and give you better visibility on the Web, so that people can find your website more easily.
