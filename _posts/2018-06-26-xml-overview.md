<br/>
<cite property="disambiguatingDescription">The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a subset of SGML that is completely described in this document. <br/>Its goal is to enable generic SGML to be served, received, and processed on the Web in the way that is now possible with HTML. <br/>XML has been designed for ease of implementation and for interoperability with both SGML and HTML.</cite>
<p property="text">
In computing, Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. The W3C's XML 1.0 Specification and several other related specifications define XML. <br/>The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. <br/>It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. <br/>Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services.
