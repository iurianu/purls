<h4>What is Google My Business?</h4>
Google My Business is a master dashboard that connects your business directly with customers, whether they’re looking for you on Search, Maps or Google Plus. Think of it as a master information hub from which you can manage all things Google will show about your business.
Unlike all social networks, besides the opportunity to connect with a community of customers, Google Plus has a significant impact on SEO and search traffic volume, as one of the largest and fastest growing social networks which, for now, is the most important for your Business.

When you enter your information, Google will find your business, and when you confirm that the information you enter is correct, you will find your location on Google maps.
In your account, you can segment and target your audience, by selecting the shared content in order to increase the likelihood of it being found, viewed and shared.
When you create a Google Plus Company page, you create new business opportunities, from being closer to the top in Google searches, to having your location added to Google maps, with directions, so everyone can see exactly where you're located, and how to get there.
One of the most important aspects of having a Google Plus Company Page is the Knowledge Graph Panel that Google will show on the SERP, while people are looking for your Company; once you’ve verified your account, and you confirmed that your account’s name, address, and place (location) information is correct, this information, along with your business hours, will be visible in search results, so it’s critical to keep up to date.
<h4><em style="font-weight: normal;">Show up on the web</em></h4>
When you get on Google, you make it easier for customers to find information about your business, including working hours, contact information and directions, so your next customer could be a click away.
<h4><em style="font-weight: normal;">Get on the map</em></h4>
When you verified your business, your information will appear in Maps, helping customers to find the directions to your location. They can also see your contact info, and the ratings and reviews of your business.
<h4><em style="font-weight: normal;">Stand out on Google Plus</em></h4>
The reviews and photos of your business and products will help your Company stand out to customers.
With Google My Business, you can edit your contact information, business description, hours, website URL and more.
<h4><em style="font-weight: normal;">Check-in on the go with the Google My Business app</em></h4>
With the Google My Business app, you can manage your business any time. From your phone or tablet, you can check customer insights, update your business hours, and share photos with customers.
<h4>How to create a Google Business Page?</h4>
As this kind of tutorial is not very often found on the internet, I'll just add step-by-step information on how to create this particular page.
<ol class="pointed">
<li>Visit <a class="alternate-url" title="Create a Google Plus Business Page" href="https://business.google.com/create">Create a business page</a> on Google Plus (or follow “All Your Google Plus Pages” in the pull down under your profile photo) and hit “create a page.”</li>
<li>Pick the right category and sub-category to perfectly describe your business or organization.</li>
<li>Find or add your business on <a class="alternate-url" href="https://business.google.com/add?sab=1">Google Maps</a>: start typing your Business name in the Search Box, and if you don't see it on the map, you will get the option to add it.</li>
</ol>

<p class="note">Note: To create a Google Plus Company Page, you must first have a personal profile.</p>

<figure class="knk-figure"><a href="http://purls.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2-googleplus-add-business-on-google-maps.jpg"><img src="http://purls.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2-googleplus-add-business-on-google-maps.jpg" alt="" width="967" height="527" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-73" /></a></figure>

<ol class="pointed">
<li>Under the "Edit Info" tab, add basic information: page name, external website, and audience.</li>
<li>Customize your page by adding a profile photo, and a cover image.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="knk-figure"><a href="http://purls.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3-googleplus-add-name-website.jpg"><img src="http://purls.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3-googleplus-add-name-website.jpg" alt="" width="883" height="610" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-74" /></a></figure>

<p class="note">Note: The cover photo works best if you have a photo of your product, company or brand that will promote and enhance your business.</p>

<figure class="knk-figure"><a href="http://purls.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/4-googleplus-profile-photo.jpg"><img src="http://purls.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/4-googleplus-profile-photo.jpg" alt="" width="974" height="323" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-75" /></a></figure>

<ol class="pointed">
<li>Under story, add a tagline: ten words that best describe your business.</li>
<li>Fill in your contact information: phone, email, chat and address.</li>
<li>Now you have to <a class="alternate-url" title="Verify your Business with Google Plus" href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/2911778?hl=en">verify your business</a> within Google.</li>
<li>When you complete the basic information, you will begin using your administration dashboard to manage your new Google Plus page. You can now use the “About” section to fill in any additional information and the "Photos" section to add images of your Store, Products, and People.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="pointed">

<li>Add links to your other social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. These links will be added through your website, by using structured data markup.</li>
<li>Post to your page by sharing links, photos and videos just like you do on your personal Google Plus profile or Facebook page.</li>
<li>Share relevant information that your followers will find most useful.</li>
