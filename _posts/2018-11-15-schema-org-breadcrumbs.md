The breadcrumbs are actually links to mark the path (in the website) to a specific page, collected in a BreadcrumbList. 
The creation of a Breadcrumblists is very simple, this being, in fact, a list of Webpages defined as points, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://schema.org/BreadcrumbList" rel="nofollow">schema.org documentation on breadcrumbs</a> presents very good examples.
The result of this implementation will be the change of the link in the Rich Snippet to a list that presents the path for the page.
