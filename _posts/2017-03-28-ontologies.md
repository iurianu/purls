<h2>Writing in The Computer Language</h2>

<h4>The Data Ontologies</h4>
Structured data started to conquer on the Internet in 1995, with the DublinCore open vocabulary. More specific vocabularies appeared later, for specific domains, and many of them are used on a large scale: beside DCMI (Dublin Core Metadata Initiative), there are also OWL (Web Ontology Language) which supersedes DAML(DARPA Agent Markup Language), SKOS, Good Relations, FOAF (Friend of a Friend), and many others.
