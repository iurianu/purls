<h2>Structuring Content for The Knowledge Graph</h2>

<h4>The Knowledge Graph</h4>

<h5>The age of strings(keywords) is over!</h5> 
No more back-linking! 
No more Black Hat SEO! 
No more fooling the Search Engines! 

The Knowledge Graph is a concept adopted by all Google, Yahoo, Bing, Yandex, Baidu, and other Search Engines in May 2012, a system that understands facts about people, places and things, and how they are all connected. 
The overall direction is more and more to a semantic web, where the Search Engines collect and interconnect data about all information on the Internet.

<h4>The Structured Data</h4>
Structured Data Markup is a standard way to annotate your content so machines can understand it. When your web pages include structured data markup, Google (and other search engines) can use that data to index your content better, present it more prominently in search results, and surface it in new experiences like voice answers, maps, and Google Now.

Structured data markup makes your content eligible for two kinds of Google features: enhanced presentation in Search Results, and answers from the Knowledge Graph.

<h4>Enhanced Presentation in Search Results</h4>
By including basic structured data appropriate to your content, your site can enhance its search results with <a class="alternate-url" href="https://developers.google.com/structured-data/rich-snippets" target="_blank" title="Rich Snippets">Rich Snippets</a>, <a class="alternate-url" href="https://developers.google.com/structured-data/breadcrumbs" title="Breadcrumbs" target="_blank">Breadcrumbs</a>, or a <a class="alternate-url" href="https://developers.google.com/structured-data/slsb-overview.html" title="Search Box" target="_blank">Sitelinks Search Box</a>.

<h4><span title="Search Engine Results Page">SERP</span> Rich Snippets</h4>

If you have an e-commerce website, you can provide Google detailed product information that will be used to display rich snippets on the results pages (e.g. price, availability, and review ratings).

<figure class="knk-figure"><a class="knk-link" href="http://purls.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/desk-lamp-1.jpg"><img class="knk-image" src="http://purls.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/desk-lamp-1.jpg" alt="Desk Lamp in SERP" width="500" height="80" /></a></figure>

Google offers full information on adding structured markup for <a class="alternate-url" href="https://developers.google.com/structured-data/rich-snippets/products#about_product_offers" target="_blank">products</a>. With a complete and correct markup, the result for your product could look like in this image.

Using markup to enable rich snippets lets you attract potential buyers while they are searching for items to buy on Google, and control your product information. You can maintain the accuracy and freshness of your product information, so your customers find the relevant, current items they're looking for.

<h4>Breadcrumbs</h4>

Breadcrumbs enabled on a page indicate its position in the site hierarchy. The user can navigate all the way up in the site hierarchy, one level at a time, by starting from the last breadcrumb in the breadcrumb trail; the last item leads to the page itself, and the breadcrumb before that leads to its parent page.

<figure class="knk-figure"><a class="knk-link" href="http://purls.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/breadcrumbs.png"><img class="knk-image" src="http://purls.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/breadcrumbs.png" alt="Breadcrumbs in SERP" width="500" height="80" /></a></figure>

When breadcrumb information is marked up in the body of a web page, Google can use it to understand and display the information on your pages in the search results, like in this image.

Breadcrumbs can contain a number of different properties that can be labeled with JSON-LD, Microdata, or RDFa markup.

<h4>Answers from the Knowledge Graph</h4>

If you're the authority for certain content, Google can treat the structured data on your site as factual and import it into the <a class="alternate-url" title="Knowledge Graph" target="_blank" href="/the-knowledge-graph/">Knowledge Graph</a>, where it can power prominent answers in Search and across Google properties. Features are available for authoritative data about <a class="alternate-url" title="Organizations" target="_blank" href="/online-entity/">organizations</a>, <a class="alternate-url" title="Events" target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/structured-data/events">events</a>, <a class="alternate-url" title="Movie Reviews" target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/structured-data/critic-reviews">movie reviews</a>, and <a class="alternate-url" title="Play Actions" target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/structured-data/actions">music/video play actions</a>.

When you have a complete and detailed markup for your Organization or Local Business, Event or Place, Google creates a Knowledge Graph Panel that will be displayed on the right side of the <span title="SERP">Results Page</span>.
