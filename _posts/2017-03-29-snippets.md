<h2>Make the Snippet Appealing for Your Visitor</h2>

<h4>Why Would I Click on a Link?</h4>

<p>That's a very good question...<br>
Why would anyone click on a link, if it's not the first result on the page, and the description is very vague: like parts of the title, parts of the menu, and a little bit of content?</p>
<p>Maybe if it was the first result on the page... but that's not very easy to get...</p>
<p>Well, the good news is that now you can customize your snippet, adding any content you want in there, to describe your page as best as it can.</p>

<h4>Rich Snippets for Homepage</h4>

<p><em>That's a tricky one!</em></p>
<p>Google won't show Rich Snippets for the Front Page of a website, no matter how much you try!</p>
<p>Then why add all that complex structured data on the front page, if the search engines seem to ignore it?</p>
<p>Well, the answer is very simple, the structured data was not created to let you show everyone that you have Star Rating, but for the Search Engines to be able to collect the most accurate information about, and from your website, and therefore, the idea of a Global Knowledge Graph Panel was born, and put into action.</p>

<h4>Why complex structured data on Homepage?</h4>

The Search Engines use the structured data on your homepage to add general information about your website, and/or organization to the Global Knowledge Graph; therefore, all the info on your homepage is used when creating the Local Business Panel, or The Knowledge Graph Panel.

<h4>The Breadcrumb Lists, and the Breadcrumbs</h4>

Why adding a Breadcrumb List is important for SEO!?

Beside telling the Search Engines the path to get to the presented page, Breadcrumb Lists create a special design on your Page Snippet, replacing the url below the Snippet title with a List that points the exact path on your website to the specific page.

<h4>How do you get the Rich Snippets</h4>

As the Rich Snippet technology was implemented just to let the users see the real quality of the information a web page presents, the Search Engines limited the possibility to create Rich Snippets only for a few types of information: <a target="_blank" href="http://purls.site/structured-data/schema-org/how-to-create-a-local-business-markup/">LocalBusiness</a>, Products, and Events.
