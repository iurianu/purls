<h4>Let's start with the beginning:</h4>
<q>Schema.org is a collaborative community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond. Webmasters use this shared vocabulary to structure metadata on their websites and to help search engines understand the published content. (<cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema.org" rel="nofollow tag" title="Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia">Wikipedia</a></cite>)</q>

Now that we got its definition, let's understand what it really does.

<h4>Why do we need Schema.org?</h4>
Isn't our website good enough for the Search Engines to be considered important?
Why is there a need for a supplementary code to be added to a website?
Weren't microformats good enough, why create another system?
...and so on.

Well, yes, anyone could ask all these questions before finding what is schema.org, why it was created, and why the Search Engines supported it, and will continue to support it even more.

The Search Engines stated that websites with structured data markup added have a better chance of being noticed, and taken more seriously than the others.
The implementation can be made in 2 different ways: as HTML attributes (RDFa or microdata), or as a JSON-LD script added in the head, or body of the website.

In 2017 Google recommended the use of the JSON-LD format wherever possible, with no other explanations; therefore, people (mostly developers) chose this way of implementation as it was way simpler than adding attributes in the HTML content of the webpage.

<span class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Given this recommendation, the same entity that issued this recommendation (Google) started to give penalties (like complete removal from the SERP) to more websites, stating that the structured data presented information which is not visible to visitors.</span>
