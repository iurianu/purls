Yeah, right, why do we need it?
Isn't our website good enough for the Search Engines to be considered important?
Why is there a need for a supplementary code to be added to a website?
Weren't microformats good enough, why create another system?
...and so on.

Well, yes, anyone could ask all these questions before finding what is schema.org, why it was created, and why the Search Engines supported it, and will continue to support it even more.
So, let's start with the beginning:
<q>Schema.org is a collaborative community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond.<br> Webmasters use this shared vocabulary to structure metadata on their websites and to help search engines understand the published content.<cite>Wikipedia</cite></q>
