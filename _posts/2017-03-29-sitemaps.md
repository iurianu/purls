<h2>To Crawl or Not To Crawl</h2>

<h4>Creating Sitemaps for Google</h4>

While deciding which pages on your site should be crawled by Google, you can determine the canonical version for each of them.<br>
You can also decide which format you want to use, and you can create your sitemap manually or choose from a number of third-party tools to generate it for you.<br>
Sitemaps usually come as XML, but they can also come in RSS, mRSS, and Atom 1.0, and even as plain text.<br>
While using a sitemap, the Search Engines know exactly which pages you want to get crawled, and don't waste time on other pages, while you don't risk to get crawled pages with unpublishable content (like "Hello From Mr. Wordpress"), or with no content at all.
