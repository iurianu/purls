<h4>Structuring the Data</h4>

In the beginning of 2012, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Yandex, and other Search Engines from all over the world came to an agreement to use a Global Knowledge Graph to be able to provide more accurate Search Results, and more complete and comprehensive information about all the Entities on the Internet.Therefore, they came up with some generally approved global structured data languages, a.k.a. <a class="alternate-url" title="Microformats" href="http://microformats.org/wiki/what-are-microformats" target="_blank">microformats</a>, used within website codes, in order to get rid of all Spam and irrelevant results, focusing on the user query.
This structured data languages create structures around the information on your website.

<h4>The First Worldwide Implementations</h4>

The first Internet Giant that implemented on a full scale this graph concept was <a class="alternate-url" title="Facebook" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook" target="_blank">Facebook</a> which implemented the <a class="alternate-url" title="OpenGraph Protocol" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Platform#Open_Graph_protocol" target="_blank"> Open Graph Protocol</a> in order to customize the shared snippet.
Very soon after, Twitter came up with the <a class="alternate-url" title="Twitter Cards" href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TwitterCards" target="_blank">Twitter Cards</a>, making possible for you to attach media to Tweets that link to your content, and for articles, images, videos, and everything that is linked from Wikimedia on Twitter to get a nice preview on Twitter.

<h4>Google's Rich Snippets</h4>

Google shows rich snippet text for some types of pages and data, for example: reviews, people, organizations and events; for information about rich snippets and microformats you can check out Google's help page on rich snippets.
<figure class="half-image"><a class="knk-link" href="http://purls.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/breadcrumbs.png"><img class="knk-image" style="border: 2px inset white; margin: 5px auto;" src="http://purls.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/breadcrumbs.png" alt="Breadcrumb" /></a></figure>

For the Page Title, Google will show up to 70 characters, and for the Snippet (a.k.a. Meta Description), it can show up to 156 characters, including spaces, from the meta description tag of a webpage.
If the website meta information includes a star rating, review, publish date, or author name, Google will use this information as part of the snippet, where all the info counts as part of the 156 characters.
For pages with a clear informational hierarchy, Google may show <a class="alternate-url" title="Breadcrumb Links" href="https://developers.google.com/structured-data/breadcrumbs#about_breadcrumbs" target="_blank">breadcrumb links</a> in the search results.

<h4>The Knowledge Graph Panels</strong></h4>

As of 2012, Google's semantic network contained over 570 million objects and more than 18 billion facts about and relationships between different objects that are used to understand the meaning of the keywords entered for the search.<br>
On December 4, 2012, the Knowledge Graph was introduced in seven more languages: Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Japanese, Russian, and Italian.<br>
In August 2014, Google announced a new initiative, the Knowledge Vault, which derives much of its data from the Knowledge Graph and the sources thereof, as well as harvesting its own data.

<h4>The Knowledge Vault</h4>

The Knowledge Vault is a knowledge base created by Google. As of 2014, it contained 1.6 billion facts which had been collated automatically from the Internet.

The Knowledge Vault is a successor to Google's Knowledge Graph. The original version of the Knowledge Graph pulls information from structured sources like Wikidata and Wikipedia, while the Knowledge Vault is an accumulation of facts from across the entire web, including structured data on websites.
The "Facts", "Entities", and "Objects" in The Knowledge Vault also include a confidence value, giving the capability of distinguishing between statements with a high probability of being true from others that may be fake.
