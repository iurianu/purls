To understand how Google Knowledge Graph works, it helps to have a general understanding of something called semantic search. Search engine users utilize two very basic types of search. The first is navigational search, and is used when someone enters a query into a search engine with the intent to navigate to a specific page or site. The second type of query is called research search, where the user is looking for information about a specific topic. Semantic search comes into play when someone performs a research query. Semantics, or the science of underlying meaning in language, is used in semantic search to delivery highly relevant results to the user by seeking to understand user intent and the meaning behind the language used in the search.

On a simple Google search, we noticed that some websites don't get the attention they should; and why do we think that? Take a look at what we got:
<figure class="knk-figure"><a href="http://purls.site/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-recipe-kgp.png"><img src="http://purls.site/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-recipe-kgp.png" alt="Recipe KGP" width="616" height="259" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-374" /></a></figure>

<h4>Google's Penalties:</h4>
Do you really think that the second recipe is better than the first? Well, it isn't.
But why does Google think the otherwise? Let me explain!

This is what Google sees for kraftcanada.com:

<p style="text-align: center;">..and this is what it sees on BBC's website:</p>

<figure class="knk-figure"><a href="http://purls.site/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/3-bbc-recipe.png"><img src="http://purls.site/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/3-bbc-recipe.png" alt="BBC Recipe Structured Data" width="913" height="350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-376" /></a></figure>

<h4>Where is the Real Problem?</h4>
The Search Engines are moving away from strings (keywords) and going into entities (structured data). They are investing in their Knowledge Graph which enhances its search engine's search results with semantic-search information gathered from trusted sources e.g., entities in the form of structured data.
This Structured Data is a new-generation mark-up used to help the Search Engines see all of the owner's entities e.g., web items that you have such as Gift Cards, Products, Store Locations, Sales, Brands and more.
The schematic markup is sponsored by all: Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex, the most important search engines in the world, which made this vocabulary a collaborative, community based, mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond.
They cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model.

<h6>What Happens Next?</h6>
Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences.
By marking up your entities, web items are converted into structured data, allowing the Search Engines to link your data with others around the web, making it Linked Data. This linked data enhances the discovery rate of your products, gift cards, store locations, brands and special offers.

<h4>Linked Data and Semantic Web</h4>

<figure class="knk-figure"><a href="http://purls.site/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/4-linked-data.jpg"><img src="http://purls.site/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/4-linked-data.jpg" alt="Linked Data" width="628" height="413" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-377" /></a></figure>

<em>The above diagram shows which Linking Open Data datasets are connected, as of August 2014. This was produced by the Linked Open Data Cloud project, which was started in 2007. Some sets may include copyrighted data which is freely available.</em>

All of your website content becomes machine readable, making it very easy for your products to be discovered by people searching the internet, when your items and products are part of the Global Knowledge Graph.
By taking advantage of this, Google and other search engines will classify your website as domain experts in your areas of expertise.
