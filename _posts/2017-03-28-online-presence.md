<h4>Your Company: an Online Entity</h4>

There are tons of websites on the internet that provide Business/Company profiles, allowing every business to brag about who they are and what they do; some of them are even used by Google and other Search Engines to create the Integrate Company Profile they use to display the Results Page Snippets and the Knowledge Graph Panel (seen on the right side of the Result Page). Some of these websites, though, are more important than others.<br> 
Google, for example, focuses on just a few of them: besides having a complete and professional Google Plus Business Page, you need to have well documented professional accounts on Facebook, Linkedin, Youtube, Twitter, and Instagram, and have them all linked to your Google Plus Business Profile.

Even though the Knowledge Graph has been out for several years, there are still very few SEOs who really understand the significance of Knowledge Graph optimization.

Well, if Google got smarter, then we need to get smarter too, in order to better understand how users can get what they search for.

Googleâ€™s goal is to give everyone the most accurate search results in the shortest amount of time. Our goal as developers and SEOs is the same: to give users precisely what they are searching for. Obviously, every Company wants those results to represent their website, which is why they need to be optimizing their web presence for the Knowledge Graph.

Well, all that is easier said than done; creating a good and well documented <strong>Online Entity</strong> is a very long shot, but it's not impossible. There are a few steps everyone must make in order to create the best Knowledge Graph in Google's data storage:

<h4>Complete Professional Profiles on Social Websites</h4>

Google gives you the possibility to add your social website profiles to your knowledge graph. When Google creates your Company's Knowledge Graph Panel, he shows links to your other profiles: Google Plus, Youtube, Instagram, Linkedin, Facebook, Pinterest, and others...

<h4>A Good Domain Name</h4>

To get the right domain name for SEO, you must consider the domain your business is in, and make it sound as much as possible as your Company name.

<h4>Meta Information</h4>
The Meta Information help Google & other Search Engines to correctly categorize your site; therefore you must provide very complete and correct information in your website's meta tags.

<h4>Emphasize Keywords</h4>
Emphasized Keywords on your page will help the search engines to analyze your site.

<h4>Outbound Links</h4>
Outbound links must lead to websites that Google consider as being of good quality, with a qualitative content.

<h4>External Links</h4>
The search engine considers the quality of the links pointing to pages on your website.

<h4>Content</h4>
New and unique page content must be continuously added on the website, to keep a good Google Ranking.

<h4>Images and Videos</h4>
Images, videos and other media are a very important part of every Web site. However, the search engines are not able to analyze those objects without your help.
