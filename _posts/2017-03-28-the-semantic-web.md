<h4>Integrating in the Web</h4>

SEO used to come on two different techniques that affect your business' website: off-page SEO, which stands of the links coming to your site from other sources, and on-page SEO, which takes into account the keyword density on the page, the content on your page, and how it relates to the content on your whole website.

<h4>The Off-page SEO</h4>

The off-page SEO techniques led to underestimating the value of on-page SEO for more than 20 years, because even a massive amount of highly unrelated links could make a high page rank for a specific term. Using high-ranked websites for back-linking, The Companies that offered SEO services fooled the Search Engines for every-time, leading the Search Engines to approach a new way of handling the search results; therefore, as of the beginning of 2012, the data-vocabularies and the linked data system (the knowledge graph) were adopted. The use of data-vocabularies help the search engines provide more accurate and relevant results.

With the introduction of the Knowledge Graph and the Linked Data, all the off-page SEO is resumed to the Professional profiles from Social Media Websites.

<h4>The On-page SEO</h4>

On-page SEO stands of more interconnected techniques, and it is very important for search engines to determine what to rank your business' website for. With the introduction of structured data markup, on-page SEO elements are used now to define online entities, like organizations, events, places etc., and customize the snippet shared for the Search Engine Results Page.The Web Crawlers are also following the inbound and outbound links to fetch data they can use to properly classify the information on your web-page, and link it to similar web pages.

<h4>Semantic Markup</h4>

Semantic Markup was introduced with the new version of <a class="alternate-url" title="HTML" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hyper Text Markup Language</a>: <a class="alternate-url" title="HTML5" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HTML5</a>.
HTML5 added more semantic tags, that can be used to clearly define the separate sections in a webpage; in my opinion, the most relevant are: article, section, nav, header, main, footer, aside, time, figure and figcaption.<br>
You must have clearly defined header tags, meta keywords, and be sure to create a code that is easy to crawl for search engine spiders.

<h4>WAI-ARIA</h4>

The Accessible Rich Internet Applications (a.k.a. <a class="alternate-url" title="WAI-ARIA" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WAI-ARIA</a>) markup was created to define a way to make Web content and Web applications accessible to people with disabilities; it especially helps with dynamic content and advanced user interface controls.
Accessibility of web content requires semantic information about structures and behaviors, in order to allow assistive technologies to offer the appropriate information to persons with disabilities. This specification provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements. These semantics were conceived in order to allow an author to properly code user interface behaviors and structural information in document markup.

<h4>The WEB Ontologies</h4>

The use of ontologies provides a very powerful way to describe objects and their relationships to other objects. Ontologies resemble class hierarchies in object-oriented programming but there are several critical differences. Since the "Semantic Web" notion finally got a meaning, more vocabularies (ontologies) were created by different Organizations/Entities, the most notable being DublinCore, DAML and OWL.

<h4><em style="font-weight:normal">The DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML)</em></h4>

The DAML language was being developed as an extension to XML (Extensible Markup Language) and RDF (Resource Description Framework). The DAML Program formally began with a meeting in August 2000 in Boston. An integration contractor and 22 technology development teams have worked to conceive this Vocabulary.
The latest release of the language (DAML+OIL) provided a rich set of constructs with which to create ontologies and to markup information so that it is machine readable and understandable for humans. Since 2006, DAML was superseded by OWL, and the support for it was interrupted.

<h4><em style="font-weight:normal">The Web Ontology Language (OWL)</em></h4>

The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a family of knowledge representation languages for authoring ontologies. The natural initialism for Web Ontology Language would be WOL instead of OWL. 
OWL 2 became a W3C recommendation in October 2009. OWL 2 introduces profiles to improve scalability in typical applications.
The W3C-endorsed OWL specification includes the definition of three variants of OWL, with different levels of expressiveness: OWL Lite, OWL DL, and OWL Full. Each of these sub-languages is a syntactic extension of its simpler predecessor.

<h4>The Structured Data Markup</h4>

The Structured Data Markup is a new markup language created in order to clearly define the structures in a web page's content. Structured Data is used to create Google's Rich Snippets, and to add data about an entity, review, event, offer etc., to the Global Knowledge Graph.<br>
If you're the authority for certain content, Google can treat the structured data on your site as factual and import it into the Knowledge Graph, where it can power prominent answers in Searches, and create the Entity's <a class="alternate-url" title="Knowledge Graph Panel" href="https://developers.google.com/structured-data/customize/social-profiles#include_your_social_profile_in_search_results" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Knowledge Graph Panel</a>.<br>
My two favorite structured data markup languages are hAtom and Schema.org Markup

<h4><em style="font-weight:normal">hAtom</em></h4>

hAtom is a microformat for marking up HTML using classes and rel attributes. <a class="alternate-url" href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="hAtom">hAtom</a> version 0.1 was released on February 28, 2006, and was used widely throughout the Web.<br>
It provides options for <a class="alternate-url" href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hentry" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="hentry">blog entries</a> (hfeed -> hentry -> entry-title -> entry-content), authorship (<a class="alternate-url" href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="hCard">hCard</a>, <a class="alternate-url" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard#vCard_4.0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="vCard">vCard</a>), ratings (<a class="alternate-url" href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hreview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="hReview">hReview</a>), and more.

<h4><em style="font-weight:normal">Schema.org</em></h4>

<a class="alternate-url" href="https://schema.org/docs/gs.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Schema.org">Schema.org</a> is a successor of data-vocabulary.org. It provides extensive markup options for every kind of entity, event, location, and so on, with the option to <a class="alternate-url" href="https://schema.org/docs/extension.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Extend the Schema.org Vocabulary">extend the existing vocabularies</a>.

<figure class="half-image"><a class="knk-link" href="http://purls.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/google-kg-1.jpg"><img class="knk-image" src="http://purls.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/google-kg-1.jpg" alt="Google's Knowledge Graph Panel" title="Google's Knowledge Graph Panel" width="340" height="400" /></a></figure>

Google recommends including the social profile in search results by using structured data markup on the official website, in order to add your information from the social profiles to the Google Knowledge Panel.

With structured data markup embedded in the official website, you can specify the social profiles; in the Knowledge Graph Panel, Google can display links to your professional profiles, but is limited to: Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, Myspace, Pinterest, SoundCloud, and Tumblr.
